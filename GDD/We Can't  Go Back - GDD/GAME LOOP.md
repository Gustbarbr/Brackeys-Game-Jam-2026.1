**Genre:** Narrative Arena Survival Shooter  
**Perspective:** 2D, single screen

**All levels** appear in a **box** directly **below the photo** and **only appear** after the player **clicks** on the screen **after each phrase**.

There are only **two types of enemies**, each representing a **symbolic stage** of the narrative.

1. **[[THE FIRST LEVEL]]** has **no enemies**. The player only needs to **press a button** to sign a document.
    
2. **[[THE SECOND LEVEL]]** features the **player** as a **defender** of the **photo**, representing himself and all his beliefs.
    
3. **[[THE THIRD LEVEL]]** still has the **player defending** the **photo**, but now he no longer sees the others as enemies.
    
4. **[[THE FOURTH LEVEL]]** has **no enemies**. It only presents the soldier’s final words.
    

If the **player dies before the final enemy** in **[[THE THIRD LEVEL]]**, a **black screen appears** with the phrase:  
**“Status: Deceased.”**  
The game then **restarts the current wave**.
