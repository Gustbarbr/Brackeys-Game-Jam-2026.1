**This level represents the loss of distinction between self and enemy.**

**Design Intent:** Enemies sharing the same appearance as the player represent the idea of fighting against those equal to oneself. The threat now carries a human identity.

It **appears** after the **player clicks** on the screen during the **showcase** of the **third phrase** of the game:  
**“I’m only following orders…”**

In the **third level**, the **enemies use the same heart sprite as the player**. There are a total of **8 enemies**:

- **3 enemies shoot**
- **2 enemies stand still while shaking**
- **3 enemies move from side to side**

After **all enemies are defeated**, a **final enemy appears**. This enemy is **immortal** and **aims directly at the player**.

In this level, the **player’s movement speed and fire rate are reduced**.

There are **no rectangles** remaining in the center of the box.
