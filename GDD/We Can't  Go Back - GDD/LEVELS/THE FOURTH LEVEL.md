**This level represents inevitable death before a stronger enemy and the sadness of not returning home.**

**Design Intent:** Enemies sharing the same appearance as the player represent the idea of fighting against those equal to oneself. The threat now carries a human identity.

It **appears** on the screen **during the showcase** of the **fourth phrase** of the game:  
**“Sorry, Mom. I won’t be coming back.”**

In this level, the **player’s movement speed and fire rate are reduced**.

The **enemies use the same heart sprite as the player** and there are a total of **8 enemies**:

- **3 enemies shoot**
- **2 enemies stand still while shaking**
- **3 enemies move from side to side**

After the **player’s death**, the **fourth photo** appears with the phrase:  
**“Sorry, Mom. I won’t be coming back.”**

After this, the screen **turns black** and **displays** the **final message**:  
**“HQ: Deploying a substitute for Soldier 1402…”**
