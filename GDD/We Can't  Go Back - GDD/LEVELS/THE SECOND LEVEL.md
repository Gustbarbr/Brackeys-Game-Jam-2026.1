**This level represents the call to action and the perception of enemies as something evil that must be destroyed.**

**Design Intent:** Enemies appearing as demons reinforce the idea of perceiving the threat as inhuman and something that must be eliminated. Static enemy behavior represents an inflexible and simplified moral worldview.

It **appears** after the **player clicks** on the screen **during the showcase** of the **second phrase** of the game:  
**“Yes, sir!”**

In the **second level**, the **player is represented by a heart** and can **shoot**. The **enemies** are **demon icons** that **shoot in a straight line**, without aiming directly at the player. There are a total of **5 enemies**.

After the **player defeats all enemies**, a **final enemy appears**. This enemy has a **larger sprite**, is **invincible**, and **moves directly toward the photo**. After colliding with the photo, the **third photo** appears with the phrase:  
**“I’m only following orders…”**

There are **two rectangles** in the **center of the box** that **block bullets** from both the **player** and the **enemies**, but they are **destroyed after 5 hits**.

All **5 enemies** are positioned in a **horizontal line**.

The **player** is positioned in the **upper half** of the box and can **move left and right**. The **enemies** are positioned in the **bottom half** of the box and **remain stationary**.
